## Introduction

The **Spheron Protocol SDK** provides developers with tools to interact with the Spheron decentralized infrastructure. It includes modules for managing compute leases, deployments, escrow operations, and more.

## How It Works

The Spheron Protocol SDK comprises two main components that work together to provide a seamless experience for interacting with the Spheron decentralized infrastructure:

### Protocol SDK

The Protocol SDK handles all deployment and escrow-specific operations, including:

- Creating Deployment Orders: Initiate new deployments on the network.
- Updating Deployments: Modify existing deployments with new configurations.
- Closing Deployments: Terminate deployments when they are no longer needed.
- Managing Escrow Balances: Track and manage your account balance within the network’s escrow system.
- Financial Transactions: Deposit and withdraw funds securely.

This component manages the blockchain transactions and smart contract interactions required for these operations.

### Provider Proxy Server

The Provider Proxy Server is essential for interacting with provider-specific functions, such as:

- Fetching Deployment Details: Retrieve information about your deployments.
- Retrieving Exposed Ports: Get details about network ports exposed by your services.
- Getting Service Details: Access information about running services.
- Checking Service Statuses: Monitor the status of your deployed applications.

The Provider Proxy Server acts as an intermediary between your application and the Spheron provider, handling both HTTP and WebSocket requests.

### Working Together

These components work hand in hand, allowing you to interact with the Spheron infrastructure without needing to build additional components:

1. Run the Provider Proxy Server: This server communicates with the Spheron provider on your behalf.
2. Pass the Provider Proxy Server URL to the Protocol SDK: This allows the SDK to route requests appropriately.
3. Use the SDK Functions: Manage deployments and interact with the Spheron infrastructure through the SDK.

By following the guide below and referring to the [Node.js SDK README](./nodejs/README.md), you'll be able to perform all necessary interactions for deployments on Spheron.

## Components

### Node.js SDK

The [Node.js SDK](./nodejs/README.md) offers a comprehensive set of functionalities to interact with the Spheron Protocol via Node.js applications.

Key features include:

- **Escrow Module**: Manage user balances, deposits, and withdrawals.
- **Deployment Module**: Create, update, retrieve, and close deployments.
- **Lease Module**: Manage compute leases, including retrieving lease details and managing active leases.

### Provider Proxy Server

The [Provider Proxy Server](./provider-proxy-server/README.md) acts as an intermediary for fetching data related to deployments from the Spheron Provider. It handles both HTTP and WebSocket requests to communicate with the Spheron provider.

## Installation and Setup

### Installing the SDK

To install the Spheron SDK in your Node.js project, use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @spheron/protocol-sdk
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @spheron/protocol-sdk
```

### Setting Up the Provider Proxy Server

To submit manifests to a provider, you need to set up a proxy server. You can run the provider proxy server using Docker or from source code.

Refer to the [Provider Proxy Server README](./provider-proxy-server/README.md) for detailed instructions.

#### Option 1: Use the Docker Image

Pull and run the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull spheronnetwork/provider-proxy-server:latest
docker run -p 3040:3040 spheronnetwork/provider-proxy-server:latest
```

#### Option 2: Run from Source Code

Clone the repository and run the server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spheronFdn/protocol-sdk.git
cd protocol-sdk/provider-proxy-server
npm install
npm run start
```

Make sure to set any necessary environment variables as described in the [Provider Proxy Server README](./provider-proxy-server/README.md).

## Usage

### Initializing the SDK

To use the Spheron SDK, import it and initialize it with the desired configuration:

```javascript
const { SpheronSDK } = require('@spheron/protocol-sdk');

// Basic initialization
const sdk = new SpheronSDK({
  networkType: 'mainnet' // 'mainnet' (default) or 'testnet'
});

// Initialization with private key for write operations
const sdk = new SpheronSDK({
  networkType: 'mainnet',
  privateKey: 'your-private-key'
});

// Full initialization with all optional parameters
const sdk = new SpheronSDK({
  networkType: 'mainnet',
  privateKey: 'your-private-key',
  rpcUrls: {
    http: 'your-http-rpc-url',
    websocket: 'your-websocket-rpc-url'
  },
  gaslessOptions: {
    type: 'coinbase', // or 'biconomy'
    bundlerUrl: 'your-bundler-url',
    paymasterUrl: 'your-paymaster-url'
  }
});
```

#### Configuration Parameters:

- `networkType` (optional): Specifies the environment - 'mainnet' (default) or 'testnet'
- `privateKey` (optional): Your private key for signing transactions
- `rpcUrls` (optional): Custom RPC URLs for the network
  - `http`: HTTP RPC endpoint
  - `websocket`: WebSocket RPC endpoint
- `gaslessOptions` (optional): Configuration for gasless transactions
  - `type`: 'coinbase' or 'biconomy'
  - `bundlerUrl`: URL for the bundler service
  - `paymasterUrl`: URL for the paymaster service

#### Using Gasless Transactions

When using gasless transactions, follow these steps:

1. First, get your smart wallet details:
```javascript
const smartWalletDetails = await sdk.escrow.getSmartWalletDetails();
console.log('Smart Wallet Address:', smartWalletDetails.address);
console.log('Smart Wallet Balance:', smartWalletDetails.balance);
```

2. Before making any deposits using `depositBalance`, ensure you have deposited funds into your smart wallet.

### Examples

Refer to the [Examples Directory](./example) for sample code demonstrating how to use various modules of the SDK.

**Example: Creating a Deployment**

```javascript
const { SpheronSDK } = require("@spheron/protocol-sdk");

const sdk = new SpheronSDK("testnet", "your-private-key");

const iclYaml = `
// Your YAML file here
`;

const providerProxyUrl = "http://localhost:3040";

(async () => {
  try {
    const deploymentTxn = await sdk.deployment.createDeployment(
      iclYaml,
      providerProxyUrl
    );
    console.log("Deployment created:", deploymentTxn);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating deployment:", error);
  }
})();
```

## Security Best Practices

- Private Key Management: Store your private key securely using environment variables or secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.
- Avoid Hardcoding Sensitive Data: Never commit sensitive information like private keys or API keys to version control.
