## Introduction

The **Spheron Protocol SDK for Node.js** provides a comprehensive set of modules to interact with the Spheron decentralized infrastructure. This includes modules for lease management, deployment operations, and escrow functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Version 14 or higher.
- npm: Version 6 or higher.
- Docker: If you plan to run the Provider Proxy Server using Docker.
- Git: For cloning the repository if running the Provider Proxy Server from source.

## Installation

Install the Spheron SDK for Node.js using npm:

```bash
npm install @spheron/protocol-sdk
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @spheron/protocol-sdk
```

## Usage

### Initializing the SDK

To use the Spheron SDK, first import it and initialize it with the desired network type:

```javascript
const { SpheronSDK } = require('@spheron/protocol-sdk');

const sdk = new SpheronSDK('testnet');
```

**Note:** Chain type can be `testnet` or `mainnet`. But currently, only `testnet` is supported.

If you want to perform write operations, you'll need to provide a private key:

```javascript
const sdk = new SpheronSDK('testnet', 'your-private-key');
```

**Note:** Never hardcode your private key; use environment variables or secure key management systems.

#### Constructor Parameters:

- `networkType`: Specifies the environment. Possible values are `'testnet'` or `'mainnet'`.
- `privateKey` (optional): Private key for signing transactions.

### Modules Overview

The SDK provides several modules for different functionalities:

- **Escrow Module**: Handles escrow-related operations, such as user balance management, deposits, withdrawals, and earnings management.
- **Deployment Module**: Facilitates the creation, updating, and closing of deployments.
- **Lease Module**: Manages compute leases, including retrieving lease details and managing active leases.

## Modules

### Escrow Module

The Escrow Module handles operations related to the escrow system, allowing users to manage their token balances within the Spheron ecosystem.

#### 1. `getUserBalance`

  },
  () => {
    console.error('Listening failed or timed out');
  },
  60000 // Timeout in milliseconds
);
```

- `onFailureCallback` (function): Function called if listening fails or times out.
- `timeout` (number, optional): Time in milliseconds before the listener times out.

## Examples

For detailed examples of how to use each module, please refer to the [Examples Directory](https://github.com/spheronFdn/protocol-sdk/tree/main/examples).

## Error Handling

It's recommended to wrap your SDK calls in `try-catch` blocks to handle any potential errors:

```javascript
try {
  const result = await sdk.someModule.someMethod();
  // Handle successful result
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  // Handle error
}
```
